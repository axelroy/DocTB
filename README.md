# DocTB
Documentation for the Bachelor Project.

Documentation written in RST format, and converted to LaTex and PDF using Sphinx.

# Installation

Do as written (here)[http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/tutorial.html] :

* `pip install Sphinx`
* `sphinx-quickstart`

then, to export as LaTex, install your favorite Tex document production binaries,
such as (TexLive)[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TeX_Live].

and then follow (these instructions)[http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/builders.html#sphinx.builders.latex.LaTeXBuilder]
to build LaTex and PDF with Sphinx.

The bibliograpy is done using the `sphinxcontrib-bibtex` plugin. You can install it
using `pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex`, and add `extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.bibtex']` to the extensions in the `conf.py` generated by `sphinx-quickstart` command.
